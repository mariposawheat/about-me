<h1>About Me</h1>
<body>
<p>
Hi my name is Mariposa Wheat, I'm 19 years old, and I am very much excited to do web development!<br>
I have 3 guinea pigs, Pua, Ame, and Gus Gus.<br>

<p>
They love eating my hair for some reason :(
<br>
I love to draw, but more on the digital side for the most part now,
<br>
I started drawing digitally when I went into Digital arts school, and I loved it ever since as a hobby.
<br>
I also love to bake as well! But I love baking more breads, bagels than cake and cupcakes.
<br>
I have 2 siblings, one younger sister, and one older brother (I'm a middle child yippiee)
My dad pointed me to this deep dive program, and I was going to do digital media first, then data science,
<br>
My older brother and younger sister take turns protecting our family home from <span style="color:green"><strong>Creepers</strong></span> every night. It's hard work but someone has to do it.
<br>
then I got into web development. I never thought about coding until now, but so far I am loving it!
